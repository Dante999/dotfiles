# Dotfiles

A collection of config files/dotfiles which I use daily at work and home.
Probably not relevant for anybody else but me :)


## Installation

Pretty easy, just execute `create_symlink.sh` and the script will create
symlinks in your home directory which points to the respective dotfiles in this
repo.
